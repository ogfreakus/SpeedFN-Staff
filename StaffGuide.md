#### Staff activity 
 - Staff activity is very important, you need to make sure you are helping out in #chat as well in the #get-help channels.
 - Admins and the [Staff Manager] will from now on be closley watching your activity **PLEASE BE ACTIVE :)**.
 - If u are unable to be active for anything thats fine! Please let an admin know though so we know you are away
    - if you go inactive without giving us a heads up, you will receive a warning, from this warning you will get a dm from [Staff Manager] asking you to be active, over the next week. we would then watch you and if you are not active over that week you may be demoted, but we are all about second chances so the [Head of recruitment] will talk to you about regaining your position AS WE KNOW YOU ARE GOOD xD.

#### Staff Rules
- Staff MUST apply to the main #rules all the time. 
- Be nice to all members even if you get mad at them
- Use punishment commands correctly and for rule-breakers only.
  - Read #staff-guide
- Dont ignore members in chat trying to get help. 
- Use common sense 
- Always be nice to everyone
  - No matter what
- **PLEASE BE ACTIVE**


#### SR roles 
- Staff Manager: **Cody**

  - The staff managers's job is to be on top of staff to make sure they are doing their job correctly. They are also making sure that all staff are [following the activity rules mentioned above] They also can promote or demote you too. 

- Head of recruitment: **SkyJumper**
  - Head of recruitment's job is to employ people for helping SpeedFN and managing applications.

- Recruiter & Sr. Mods: **Oli, Kendrick**
  - These people help go through the staff applications and help us decide who will be in the staff team! 


#### Trial Helper  
 - When you first become staff you become a trial helper, this period will last for 5 days, in this time you must be active in the help channels and #chat and learn all about how to moderate and help in SpeedFN. After the 5 days, if the [Staff Manager] and the [Head of recruitment] are happy we will welcome you to the staff team! Keep in mind that if you do something that we do not like, you will be kicked off the staff team without an notice

#### Promotions
 - Staff promotions are based on two factors. One, The number of staff members in specific groups, and two, Retention and activity. Remember to always be active and you may be promoted in the future! The [Staff Manager] handles promotions, with recommendations from other Administrators. You must go through the ranks one by one. For example, you cannot become a senior moderator when you are a helper. You must first be promoted from helper to moderator, and then be promoted again to senior moderator. You can also recieve promotions at any time without warning. You can also be demoted without warning as well.
